            <h2 class="content-heading">The Journey So Far...</h2>
            <p class="content"> My transitioning into started a few years ago when surfing the internet became an hobby.
                There and then
                I began to see the amazing things I could do withe the the internet. Being the person I am, always
                wanting to know the why behind anything of interest to me, I began to find a way to tap into this
                tecnology. I started off with building a company website with the use of Wordpress, which did not rquire
                code. But I felt that was limited, as the theme was fix and one could do little or no adjustment to the
                theme. So I got searching and discovered the power behind coding and how it can make web-development
                dynamic and flexible. Now I am on the part of studying to become a software developer, to create amazing
                websites and softwares that meet and solve pressing needs.</p>
